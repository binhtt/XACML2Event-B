## ðŸ“Œ Overview

**XACML2Event-B** is a tool-supported framework that enables formal verification of access control policies specified in [XACML 3.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/). The tool chain transforms policies from:
1. **Textual rules** â†’  
2. **XACML format** â†’  
3. **Event-B models**,  
which are then automatically verified using the [Rodin platform](https://www3.hhu.de/stups/rodin.html).

The approach supports:
- Static conflict detection via invariant analysis,
- Proof-based validation of semantic correctness,
- Completeness checking for access request coverage.
